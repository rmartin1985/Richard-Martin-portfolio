  ## Description
 Hello! I'm Richard. Recently becomming a Full Stack Developer has been an excellent journey of personal and professional growth.
My background has always been in customer service with over a decade in the restaurant industry and most recently in real estate.
Web Development is just another extension of customer service. Highly motivated and dedicated to my clients to listen to their needs, understand the product they envision, and then be able to create and deliver to them in a timely and efficient manner.
Whether creating a project solo or joining a team and collaborating to create something exciting and functional, I will work deligently until the final produt is exactly what was asked for.

In my personal life, I like to spend most of my nights hanging in with my beautiful wife, our dog Meatball
the Great Pyrenees, and our cat Jersey the Maine Coon. I love to cook and I am always on the look out for a
new recipe each week. I try to learn a new skill in the kitchen and perfect my craft every time I attempt a
new dish. We are also season ticket holders for the Austin FC soccer team. If I am not cooking for my family
or at a soccer game, then you can bet you will find me at a concert or any one of our Emo nights dancing and singing to the songs of my childhood.

                Hello! Iâ€™m Richard. I am currently studying to be a full stack web developer through the University of Texas
                in Austin Coding Bootcamp. After years in the restaurant industry and most recently in Real Estate as an
                apartment locator, I am excited to take the next challenge and venture in to the world of web development. I
                have always excelled at any customer service role and I see web development as just another extension of
                customer service. I pride myself on being able to understand the needs of my client and deliver a product to
                them exactly as asked for.<br></br><br></br>

                In my personal life, I like to spend most of my nights hanging in with my beautiful wife, our dog Meatball
                the Great Pyrenees, and our cat Jersey the Maine Coon. I love to cook and I am always on the look out for a
                new recipe each week. I try to learn a new skill in the kitchen and perfect my craft every time I attempt a
                new dish. We are also season ticket holders for the Austin FC soccer team. If I am not cooking for my family
                or at a soccer game, then you can bet you will find me at a concert or any one of our Emo nights dancing and
                singing to the songs of my childhood.
